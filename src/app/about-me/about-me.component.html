                <p>
                    My several years of experience as a CNC turner and the process-oriented view of
                    workflows that come with it contributed to my decision to pursue an education in IT. As an avid
                    car/tuning enthusiast, my interest in software solutions and new technical innovations is very high
                    and a constant companion in my life.
                    During my IT training, I quickly realized that analytical thinking and recognizing logical
                    connections are my strengths, and these are the challenges I would like to face in the future.
                    Within the framework of various project-based learning methods, I was able to implement various
                    software projects both in a team and independently.
